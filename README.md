## Included Filters

Issues
--------------------
If you come across something that seems like a bug, please report it here. Make sure to follow these guidelines to ensure your report isn't closed as "Invalid":

* Make sure you are using the latest Release version of the script. Old versions of the script are unsupported. Features and fixes will not be backported to old versions.
* Search to see if someone else has already reported the bug. Duplicate reports just slow down getting things fixed.
* Include steps to reproduce the issue in your report. Screenshots or videos may also prove helpful.

Feature Requests
----------------
Have an idea for other new filters or features that would fit well in this script? Awesome! File an issue and detail your idea. Keep it succinct and on-point, and only one feature per request, or it will be closed as "Invalid". Then we'll discuss your idea some and decide whether to implement it or not.

Contributions
-------------
This script is open source! That means if you'd like to try your hand at fixing a bug or implementing a feature, please do so! Head over to the Issues page and look for any open issues tagged with the "Accepted" label. Create a branch, work on it, then submit a pull request. We'll work together to iron out any concerns with your code, and then we'll merge it in and your code will become a part of this script's legacy!
